                    Hi, welcome everyone to my final presentation for my master's thesis
                    "differentiable projection operations for X-ray computed tomography"
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    You can find the slides, on the github.io link here below. I also copied that in
                    the chat, just if you want to take a closer look at anything.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    I'm going to talk about what projection operations are, specifically, in the
                    context of X-ray CT. Then I'll try to motivate the importance of
                    differentiability, and finally, I'll dive a little deeper on the implementation
                    of projection operations. I'm not going to cover X-ray CT completely, but I'll
                    try to cover some basics, so everyone can follow.
                    </p>

                    end to go over it again.

                    In short, projection operations, or operators are approximations of the physical
                    forward model. The forward model is the mathematical description of the
                    capturing process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    This capturing process for X-ray attenuation CT, is illustrated with the bottom
                    pictures. If one use a CT scanner to measure the abdomen depicted on the left,
                    one would get the measurements on the right. Now the forward model, is the
                    description of this process. For X-ray CT, this boils down to the so called line
                    integral.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    But do note, that the picture on the left, is not measurable, it is only
                    reconstructable from the measured data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    So just remember, projection operations are just the approximation of this
                    mathematical description of the measuring process.

                <h3>Why are should the projection operation be differentiable?</h3>
                <p>Differentiability needed in the forward model of differentiable phase-contrast
                CT. Without differentiable basis, numerical differentiation is necessary.</p>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>
                    So, when does it matter, that the projection operations are differentiable?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    First, in the continuous setting this is not a problem. This only happens,
                    due to the discretization of the problem, such that one can use computers to
                    work with it. So, by taking the naive approximation, one gets projection
                    operations, which are not differentiable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    For the approximation of something like X-ray attenuation CT, this doesn't
                    necessarily matter. Differentiability is not part of the physical measuring
                    process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    However, for imaging modalities based on differentiable phase-contrast, this is
                    the case. Without going into details of it, but as the name suggests,
                    differentiation is important there. And to support such imaging modalities, one
                    needs either, differentiable projection operations, or an additional numerical
                    differentiation step. The latter is not optimal, so a good description and
                    approximation of the measurement process is desirable.

                <h3>On the way to differentiable projection operators</h3>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>
                    I already mentioned, that adding differentiability back into the projection
                    operations is only necessary, as the often chosen discretization, is not
                    differentiable.

                    So, we'll briefly look into how a signal can be discretized.

                    \[
                    f \approx \hat{f}(\cdot) = \sum_{i=1}^{I} c_i b(\cdot - x_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{I}
                    c_i b_i(\cdot)

                    <p>
                    A common method for discretization is the so-called series expansion. One
                    approximates the signal 'f', by a linear combination of a coefficient vector
                    'c' and a zero-centered symmetrical basis function 'b'. The 'x_i' denotes
                    the center of the 'i'th grid point of the discretization, and hence, shifts
                    everything over to use the zero-center basis function.

                    <p>
                    Worth mentioning here is, that if one applies a linear operator to the series
                    expansion, as it can be seen here. It only acts on the basis function. Hence, if
                    one applies the derivative operator for example, as long as the basis function is
                    differentiable, this works out fine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    So what are common or good choices for such basis functions?

                    <p>
                    So quite a lot is going on here. First focus on the left column.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    From top to bottom, three basis functions are shown, the pixel basis function,
                    the B-Spline basis function of different orders, and the blob basis function for
                    a couple of different parameters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The pixel basis function is super common and ubiquitous. It's used everywhere.
                    It is a piecewise linear function and not differentiable at the boundaries. It's
                    the default basis function for pretty much everything.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Beneath, is the B-Spline basis, a generalization of the pixel basis. The
                    B-Spline of order 'd' is defined as the 'd+1' time convolution of the pixel
                    basis function with itself. The basis function tents quite quickly to a Gaussian
                    bell, however the support remains compact. The support is larger though than for
                    the pixel basis for orders larger than 0.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Lastly, at the bottom, the blob basis function is a spherically-symmetric basis
                    function, which means all cross-sections going through the center of the blob,
                    are the same. It is parameterised by 'a' the radius, 'm' controlling the
                    differentiablilty, and 'alpha' controlling the roll-off, or taper.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    So why are these basis functions interesting? Both B-Splines and Blobs are known
                    to provide better accuracy compared to pixel basis function in many different
                    applications. But here, we focus on the implications of the forward model for
                    X-ray attenuation CT, which is seen in the right column.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    This is just the Radon Transform. This means, imagine a X-ray source on one side
                    of the basis function emitting parallel X-rays and a detector on the other. This
                    is a single projection. This can be rotated around to give multiple projections
                    at different projection angles. The different curves shown in the right
                    column, show the intensity of the X-ray shadow for three different projection
                    angles. That is, the higher the curve, the darker the shadow is. Or differently,
                    the higher the curve, the more energy was absorbed or attenuation of the X-ray
                    traversing the basis function.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    What is to point out here, is mostly the pixel basis function depends highly on
                    the projection angle, so which direction the X-rays travel through the basis
                    function.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    For blobs, at the bottom right this does not matter at all, as they have the
                    same Radon Transform for all projection angles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    B-Splines are the in-between. The higher the order, the closer the Radon
                    Transform gets to be independent of the projection angle. Already cubic
                    B-Splines are quite close to be spherically-symmetric.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    As a last point for this slide, using B-Spline or Blob basis functions as a
                    discretization in the series expansion yields differentiable projection
                    operations. Under the assumptions, that parameters are chosen correctly.

                    With that lengthy part out of the way. Let's look at first at a classical
                    approach to implement such a projection operations for X-ray CT. And then follow
                    it up with the approach taken in my thesis for B-Spline and blob basis functions.

                    What you see here is a simplified version of a typical X-ray CT setup. You have a
                    source one side, the detector on the other side and in between the image one
                    wants to scan. The image is discretized using a regular grid with a value in
                    the center of each grid cell. Here, the pixel basis function is additionally
                    depicted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    For simplicity, we only consider one single ray, but you have to imagine that
                    this is done for many rays for each projection, with many different projection
                    angles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Now, the task of projection operations or often referred to as projectors is to
                    calculate the values of the 'a's. These are the contributions of a single ray to
                    the measurement, in this case 'm_1'.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    So how can this be calculated?

                <h3>Classical Ray-driven approach for pixel basis</h3>
                <div data-id="box"><img src="./imgs/siddon_traversal.png"></div>

                    <p>
                    For the pixel basis function, one can take the intersection length of the ray
                    and an individual pixel. This works as the pixel has a constant value inside.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    With that the values written here in the blue pixels, are the weights calculated
                    by such a method. In this case, this method is usually referred to as Siddon's
                    method.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Note here, that pixels where the ray traverse through a larger distance have a
                    larger contribution. And if only the border is hit, the contribution is less.
                    All pixels which are white, have a contribution of zero.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    To extent this basic principle to B-Splines and Blobs, some difficulties arise,
                    one need to deal with. Both basis functions usually have a support which is
                    larger than that of a pixel, plus it's overlapping. Further, the basis functions
                    are not constant anymore, so the naive intersection length doesn't help anymore.
                    </p>

                <h3>Ray-driven approach for B-Spline and Blob basis</h3>
                <div data-id="box"><img src="./imgs/slice_traversal_clean.png"></div>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>
                    The larger and overlapping support is dealt with by just visiting neighbouring
                    pixels. Here, basis functions of radius one are assumed, but usually they are
                    larger than that. Pixels perpendicular to the main ray direction are visited.
                    The darker blue ones, are always the center pixels visited, and the lighter ones
                    the additionally visited ones.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Instead of the naive intersection length, one can pre calculate the contribution
                    of a basis function to a ray, given it's distance from the center of the basis.
                    For blobs, an equation exists for that, which can be easily implemented, for
                    B-Spline a slight trick is used. Basically, it is assumed all rays traverse the
                    B-Spline at a zero degree projection angle. This works, due to the close
                    approximation of a spherically-symmetric basis function.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    So once, one has these pre calculated contributions, one can just take the
                    perpendicular distance, depicted as dashed black lines, of a center of the basis
                    functions to the ray, and use that to look up the contributions values.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Note this approach, works for all basis functions, which are at least close to
                    spherically symmetric and hence not depend on the projection angle.

                    Lastly, this has to be done obviously for the complete image. And here it is
                    depicted to see how many pixels the algorithm visits for a basis with radius 1.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    But for a basis radius of 2, at each slice, one needs to visit in total 5
                    pixels in 2D, and in 3D this number goes up to 25 voxels, which is quite quite
                    a lot.

                    Here, a reconstruction was performed, using the Shepp-Logan phantom in 2D, a
                    basic setup with a 180 degree circular trajectory was used with FISTA as a
                    reconstruction algorithm. For the projector using Blobs, the radius was 2, and
                    cubic B-Splines are used.

                    The reconstruction on the right, is the Siddon's projector, that uses the pixel
                    basis and approximates the forward model using the intersection lengths. And
                    compared to that, both new projectors do quite well. The Siddon's projector is
                    known for its high frequency artifacts, and both new projectors, don't exhibit
                    such artifacts in most cases, due to their larger footprint.
